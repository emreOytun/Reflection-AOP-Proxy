# Reflection-AOP-Proxy
Includes my work on the subjects reflections and aspect oriented programming. <br>

# What's inside?
- There is a method to copy an instance to another using reflections
- There is a mini framework demo that shows how a framework initializes the classes it controls and how aspects are implemented internally.
